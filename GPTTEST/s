To develop Relio in 7 weeks, you need to create a detailed project plan and have a clear understanding of the features to include in the app, as well as their interdependencies. Also, an agile development methodology would be well-suited for such a project, allowing for flexibility and iterative progress.

Week 1: Project Planning and Research

Set clear objectives, deliverables, and timelines for the project.
Conduct competitor research and need-finding to validate and refine the proposed features.
Identify the core functionality for the MVP (Minimum Viable Product).
Week 2: Design

Create user personas and map out user flows.
Develop wireframes for the app's screens and features.
Start visual design.
Week 3: Development (Backend + Frontend for MVP Features)

Setup the development environment (version control system, databases, servers).
Begin developing the MVP features (reminders, task lists, contact profiles, timeline).
Ayush and Manav could work on the frontend for the MVP features (using a framework like React), while Anu and Dhruv could work on the backend (using a framework like Node.js and a database like MongoDB).
Week 4: Development (Backend + Frontend for MVP Features)

Continue development and start integrating the frontend and backend.
Week 5: Development (Advanced Features)

Start developing the advanced features (sentiment analysis, user clouds, tagging systems).
Ayush and Manav could work on the frontend for the advanced features, while Anu and Dhruv could work on the backend.
Week 6: Testing and Debugging

Conduct thorough testing of all features to identify and fix bugs.
Rachel could help with data-driven testing, using datasets to simulate user behavior and test the system under realistic conditions.
Saipriya, being an entry-level developer, could assist with bug fixing and other tasks under the guidance of the more experienced developers.
Week 7: Deployment, Feedback and Iteration

Deploy the app and conduct usability testing.
Gather user feedback and make necessary revisions.
Prepare for launch.
It's important to note that development is an iterative process. Be prepared to adjust your plans and adapt as you receive feedback and identify new challenges. Hold regular standup meetings with the development team to discuss progress, identify bottlenecks, and maintain alignment with the project timeline.

Regarding the architecture for Relio, here's a simple proposed architecture:

Front-End: Develop the user interface using a JavaScript library like React.js or Vue.js. Implement CSS Frameworks for user interface design and HTML templating engines for reusable components.

Back-End: Develop the server-side application using a framework like Node.js, and Express.js for routing and middleware. Implement JWT for secure user authentication.

Database: Use MongoDB for storing user data, relationship data, reminders, etc. Use Mongoose to model your application data.

AI: Implement machine learning libraries like TensorFlow.js for sentiment analysis and natural language processing.

Server: Use a cloud service like AWS or Google Cloud Platform to host your application.

Version Control: Use Git for version control and GitHub for code collaboration and code review.

Remember, this is just a basic layout. As you work on the project, you may find better options or have to adapt the architecture to fit your needs.
